      <p>With a Master of Business Analytics from Schulich School of Business
      and robust experience in solutions in technology at VMware, I excel in
      Python, SQL, and data visualization. My work showcases my machine
      learning, business intelligence, and AI skills. I thrive in roles that
      blend technical expertise with strategic business insights, making me
      ideal for business analyst and data analyst
      positions.</p><blockquote><p>The longer I live, the more I realize that I
      am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly
      taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!</p></blockquote>
